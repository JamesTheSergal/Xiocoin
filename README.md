# Xiocoin

#### An experimental Crypto

#### What is Xiocoin?

Xiocoin is a general purpose SHA256 cryptocurrency based on similar principles as bitcoin, except made in Java. 
This project is based on (and is almost a direct translation of) [nathan-149/CustomCryptocurrency](https://github.com/nathan-149/CustomCrypocurrency) except in java of course at this point in development. As the development of this project gets bigger, it will eventually part ways from this project.

#### Direction of the project? 

Well, I don't know.
